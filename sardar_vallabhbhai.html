                            <p>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel,[7][8] one of the six
                                children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat. He followed
                                Vaishnavism
                                and belonged to Pushtimarg sect of Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya and took the diksha from
                                the
                                descendant of Vallabhacharya.[9] Patel's date of birth was never officially recorded;
                                Patel
                                entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers.[10] He belonged to the
                                Leva Patel community of Central Gujarat, although after his fame, both Leva Patel and
                                Kadava
                                Patidar have claimed him as one of their own.[11]

                                Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living
                                self-sufficiently
                                with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts
                                that
                                he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, even as the barber charged with doing
                                it
                                trembled.[12] When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he
                                was
                                generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job.
                                Patel
                                himself, though, harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds,
                                travel
                                to England, and become a barrister.[13] Patel spent years away from his family, studying
                                on
                                his own with books borrowed from other lawyers, passing his examinations within two
                                years.
                                Fetching his wife Jhaverba from her parents' home, Patel set up his household in Godhra
                                and
                                was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel – now an
                                advocate – earned a reputation as a fierce and skilled lawyer. The couple had a
                                daughter,
                                Maniben, in 1903 and a son, Dahyabhai, in 1905. Patel also cared for a friend suffering
                                from
                                the Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the
                                disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an
                                isolated
                                house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple);
                                there,
                                he recovered slowly.[14]

                                Patel practised law in Godhra, Borsad, and Anand while taking on the financial burdens
                                of
                                his homestead in Karamsad. Patel was the first chairman and founder of "Edward Memorial
                                High
                                School" Borsad, today known as Jhaverbhai Dajibhai Patel High School. When he had saved
                                enough for his trip to England and applied for a pass and a ticket, they were addressed
                                to
                                "V. J. Patel," at the home of his elder brother Vithalbhai, who had the same initials as
                                Vallabhai. Having once nurtured a similar hope to study in England, Vithalbhai
                                remonstrated
                                his younger brother, saying that it would be disreputable for an older brother to follow
                                his
                                younger brother. In keeping with concerns for his family's honour, Patel allowed
                                Vithalbhai
                                to go in his place.[15]

                                In 1909 Patel's wife Jhaverba was hospitalised in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to undergo
                                major surgery for cancer. Her health suddenly worsened and, despite successful emergency
                                surgery, she died in the hospital. Patel was given a note informing him of his wife's
                                demise
                                as he was cross-examining a witness in court. According to witnesses, Patel read the
                                note,
                                pocketed it, and continued his cross-examination and won the case. He broke the news to
                                others only after the proceedings had ended.[16] Patel decided against marrying again.
                                He
                                raised his children with the help of his family and sent them to English-language
                                schools in
                                Bombay. At the age of 36, he journeyed to England and enrolled at the Middle Temple Inn
                                in
                                London. Completing a 36-month course in 30 months, Patel finished at the top of his
                                class
                                despite having had no previous college background.[17]

                                Returning to India, Patel settled in Ahmedabad and became one of the city's most
                                successful
                                barristers. Wearing European-style clothes and sporting urbane mannerisms, he became a
                                skilled bridge player. Patel nurtured ambitions to expand his practice and accumulate
                                great
                                wealth and to provide his children with modern education. He had made a pact with his
                                brother Vithalbhai to support his entry into politics in the Bombay Presidency, while
                                Patel
                                remained in Ahmedabad to provide for the family.[18][19]

                            nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj – self-rule – from Britain. A month
                            later, he met Gandhi for the first time at the Gujarat Political Conference in Godhra. On
                            Gandhi's encouragement, Patel became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that
                            would become the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress. Patel now energetically
                            fought against veth – the forced servitude of Indians to Europeans – and organised relief
                            efforts in the wake of plague and famine in Kheda.[20] The Kheda peasants' plea for
                            exemption from taxation had been turned down by British authorities. Gandhi endorsed waging
                            a struggle there, but could not lead it himself due to his activities in Champaran. When
                            Gandhi asked for a Gujarati activist to devote himself completely to the assignment, Patel
                            volunteered, much to Gandhi's delight.[21] Though his decision was made on the spot, Patel
                            later said that his desire and commitment came after intense personal contemplation, as he
                            realised he would have to abandon his career and material ambitions.[22]

                            Patel, formed the "triumvirate" that ruled India from 1948 to 1950. Prime Minister Nehru was
                            intensely popular with the masses, but Patel enjoyed the loyalty and the faith of rank and
                            file Congressmen, state leaders, and India's civil servants. Patel was a senior leader in
                            the Constituent Assembly of India and was responsible in large measure for shaping India's
                            constitution.[71]

                            Patel was the chairman of the committees responsible for minorities, tribal and excluded
                            areas, fundamental rights, and provincial constitutions. Patel piloted a model constitution
                            for the provinces in the Assembly, which contained limited powers for the state governor,
                            who would defer to the president – he clarified it was not the intention to let the governor
                            exercise power that could impede an elected government.[71] He worked closely with Muslim
                            leaders to end separate electorates and the more potent demand for reservation of seats for
                            minorities.[72] His intervention was key to the passage of two articles that protected civil
                            servants from political involvement and guaranteed their terms and privileges.[71] He was
                            also instrumental in the founding the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police
                            Service, and for his defence of Indian civil servants from political attack; he is known as
                            the "patron saint" of India's services. When a delegation of Gujarati farmers came to him
                            citing their inability to send their milk production to the markets without being fleeced by
                            intermediaries, Patel exhorted them to organise the processing and sale of milk by
                            themselves, and guided them to create the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers' Union
                            Limited, which preceded the Amul milk products brand. Patel also pledged the reconstruction
                            of the ancient but dilapidated Somnath Temple in Saurashtra. He oversaw the restoration work
                            and the creation of a public trust, and pledged to dedicate the temple upon the completion
                            of work (the work was completed after his death and the temple was inaugurated by the first
                            President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad).

                            When the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir began in September 1947, Patel immediately wanted to
                            send troops into Kashmir. But, agreeing with Nehru and Mountbatten, he waited until
                            Kashmir's monarch had acceded to India. Patel then oversaw India's military operations to
                            secure Srinagar and the Baramulla Pass, and the forces retrieved much territory from the
                            invaders. Patel, along with Defence Minister Baldev Singh, administered the entire military
                            effort, arranging for troops from different parts of India to be rushed to Kashmir and for a
                            major military road connecting Srinagar to Pathankot to be built in six months.[73] Patel
                            strongly advised Nehru against going for arbitration to the United Nations, insisting that
                            Pakistan had been wrong to support the invasion and the accession to India was valid. He did
                            not want foreign interference in a bilateral affair. Patel opposed the release of Rs. 550
                            million to the Government of Pakistan, convinced that the money would go to finance the war
                            against India in Kashmir. The Cabinet had approved his point but it was reversed when
                            Gandhi, who feared an intensifying rivalry and further communal violence, went on a
                            fast-unto-death to obtain the release. Patel, though not estranged from Gandhi, was deeply
                            hurt at the rejection of his counsel and a Cabinet decision.[74]

                            In 1949 a crisis arose when the number of Hindu refugees entering West Bengal, Assam, and
                            Tripura from East Pakistan climbed to over 800,000. The refugees in many cases were being
                            forcibly evicted by Pakistani authorities, and were victims of intimidation and
                            violence.[75] Nehru invited Liaquat Ali Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan, to find a peaceful
                            solution. Despite his aversion, Patel reluctantly met Khan and discussed the matter. Patel
                            strongly criticised Nehru's plan to sign a pact that would create minority commissions in
                            both countries and pledge both India and Pakistan to a commitment to protect each other's
                            minorities.[76] Syama Prasad Mookerjee and K. C. Neogy, two Bengali ministers, resigned, and
                            Nehru was intensely criticised in West Bengal for allegedly appeasing Pakistan. The pact was
                            immediately in jeopardy. Patel, however, publicly came to Nehru's aid. He gave emotional
                            speeches to members of Parliament, and the people of West Bengal, and spoke with scores of
                            delegations of Congressmen, Hindus, Muslims, and other public interest groups, persuading
                            them to give peace a final effort.[77]

                            In April 2015 the Government of India declassified surveillance reports suggesting that
                            Patel, while Home Minister, and Nehru were among officials involved in alleged
                            government-authorised spying on the family of Subhas Chandra Bose.[78]

                            </summary><p>Rajmohan Gandhi, in his book writes that Nehru was focused on maintaining
                            religious harmony, casting an independent foreign policy, and constructing a technological
                            and industrial base, while Patel focused on getting the princely states to join the Indian
                            Union, modernising the administrative services, and constructing a cross-party consensus on
                            the significant elements of the Constitution.[84]

                            Patel was intensely loyal to Gandhi, and both he and Nehru looked to him to arbitrate
                            disputes. However, Nehru and Patel sparred over national issues.[85] When Nehru asserted
                            control over Kashmir policy, Patel objected to Nehru's sidelining his home ministry's
                            officials.[86] Nehru was offended by Patel's decision-making regarding the states'
                            integration, having consulted neither him nor the Cabinet. Patel asked Gandhi to relieve him
                            of his obligation to serve, believing that an open political battle would hurt India. After
                            much personal deliberation and contrary to Patel's prediction, Gandhi on 30 January 1948
                            told Patel not to leave the government. A free India, according to Gandhi, needed both Patel
                            and Nehru. Patel was the last man to privately talk with Gandhi, who was assassinated just
                            minutes after Patel's departure.[87] At Gandhi's wake, Nehru and Patel embraced each other
                            and addressed the nation together. Patel gave solace to many associates and friends and
                            immediately moved to forestall any possible violence.[88] Within two months of Gandhi's
                            death, Patel suffered a major heart attack; the timely action of his daughter, his
                            secretary, and a nurse saved Patel's life. Speaking later, Patel attributed the attack to
                            the grief bottled up due to Gandhi's death.[89]

                            Criticism arose from the media and other politicians that Patel's home ministry had failed
                            to protect Gandhi. Emotionally exhausted, Patel tendered a letter of resignation, offering
                            to leave the government. Patel's secretary persuaded him to withhold the letter, seeing it
                            as fodder for Patel's political enemies and political conflict in India.[90] However, Nehru
                            sent Patel a letter dismissing any question of personal differences or desire for Patel's
                            ouster. He reminded Patel of their 30-year partnership in the independence struggle and
                            asserted that after Gandhi's death, it was especially wrong for them to quarrel. Nehru,
                            Rajagopalachari, and other Congressmen publicly defended Patel. Moved, Patel publicly
                            endorsed Nehru's leadership and refuted any suggestion of discord, and dispelled any notion
                            that he sought to be prime minister.[90]

                            Nehru gave Patel a free hand in integrating the princely states into India.[62] Though the
                            two committed themselves to joint leadership and non-interference in Congress party affairs,
                            they sometimes would criticise each other in matters of policy, clashing on the issues of
                            Hyderabad's integration and UN mediation in Kashmir. Nehru declined Patel's counsel on
                            sending assistance to Tibet after its 1950 invasion by the People's Republic of China and on
                            ejecting the Portuguese from Goa by military force.[91]

                            When Nehru pressured Rajendra Prasad to decline a nomination to become the first President
                            of India in 1950 in favour of Rajagopalachari, he angered the party, which felt Nehru was
                            attempting to impose his will. Nehru sought Patel's help in winning the party over, but
                            Patel declined, and Prasad was duly elected. Nehru opposed the 1950 Congress presidential
                            candidate Purushottam Das Tandon, a conservative Hindu leader, endorsing Jivatram Kripalani
                            instead and threatening to resign if Tandon was elected. Patel rejected Nehru's views and
                            endorsed Tandon in Gujarat, where Kripalani received not one vote despite hailing from that
                            state himself.[92] Patel believed Nehru had to understand that his will was not law with the
                            Congress, but he personally discouraged Nehru from resigning after the latter felt that the
                            party had no confidence in him.

                            Godse.[96] Following the assassination, many prominent leaders of the Hindu nationalist
                            organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were arrested, and the organisation was
                            banned on 4 February 1948 by Patel. During the court proceedings in relation to the
                            assassination Godse began claiming that he had left the organisation in 1946.[97]
                            Vallabhbhai Patel had remarked that the "RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after
                            Gandhi's death".[98]

                            The charged RSS leaders were acquitted of the conspiracy charge by the Supreme Court of
                            India. Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal
                            Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of
                            the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same. Patel then
                            demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution[99] and
                            make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the Constitution of India,
                            accept the Tricolor as the National Flag of India, define the power of the head of the
                            organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation
                            of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce
                            violence and secrecy.[100][101][102]

                            Golwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned
                            again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any
                            of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's
                            constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for
                            selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the
                            organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead
                            letter'.[103]

                            On 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique
                            stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS
                            leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India
                            and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the
                            Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.[102][104]
